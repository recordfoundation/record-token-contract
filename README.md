# Record ICO Contract

Please see below description of [Record ICO][record] smart contract developed by [RecordFoundation].

## Overview
Record Token smart-contract is structured upon [ERC20 standard](erc20).
One of distinctive features of the smart-contract is the fact that token price is fixed and pegged to USD instead of ETH which protects investors from volatility risks of ETH currency. This technical feature is made possible by usage of Oracle that updates ETH/USD actual exchange rate in the smart contract every 30 minutes. The token price is set to $0.15 apiece.


## The Crowdsale Specification
*	Record token is ERC-20 compliant.
*   Allocation of Appics tokens goes in the following way:
* ICO 50%
* Founders and Team 18%
* RecordFarm Ecosystem 15%
* Investors 5%
* Advisors and Ambassadors 8%
* Bounty Program 4%

## Code

**unfreeze**
```cs
function unfreeze() external managerOnly

function freeze() external managerOnly
```

**buyForInvestor**
```cs
function buyForInvestor(address _investor,uint256 _xapValue,string _txHash) external controllersOnly

buyForInvestor function is called by one of controllers. It uses buyTokens(address _investor, uint256 _xapValue) function to allocate tokens to investors who make a deposit in non-ETH currencies.

**buyTokens**
```cs
function buyTokens(address _investor, uint256 _xapValue) internal startedOnly
```
internal function that called by buyForInvestor and fallback functions

## Prerequisites
1. nodejs, and make sure it's version above 8.0.0
2. npm
3. truffle
4. testrpc

## Run tests
1. run `testrpc -a 20 -l 8000000` in terminal
2. run `truffle test` in another terminal to execute tests.

## Structure of tests
1. check that function setRate works properly
2. try to buy tokens before starting round(test gives an error that falls to .catch)
3. start round
4. check that function getBonus works properly
5. set RateETH = 1 to check that contract rounds numbers right(1$ = 20/3 XAP)
6. buy tokens for 30, 31, 32 Wei and watch how contract rounds numbers
7. check we can't withdraw ether(round isn't finished)
8. pause round
9. check that we cannot buy tokens
10. start round again
11. check that we can buy tokens after second start
12. finish round
13. check that we cannot buy tokens
14. unfreeze tokens
15. withdraw ether
16. check that tokens aren't frozen (send from one account to another)
17. freeze tokens
18. check that tokens are frozen (try to send from one account to another)

## Deploy contract with truffle to network

1. Change parameters of constructor in migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js
2. Add network to truffle.js:
    live: {
      host: "localhost",
      port: 8545, //port where node is running
      network_id: "1" ,// Match any network id. 1- live network, 2 - ropsten, 3 - rinkeby
      gas: 7721975 //optional
    }
3. In console in ico-smartcontract-appics then run: truffle compile
4. In geth console unlock wallet which will be used for deploy
5. Then use command: truffle migrate --network live
